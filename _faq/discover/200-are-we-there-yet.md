Molecule framework aims to be focused in terms of its functionality and we believe it is better to leave out a feature when in doubt than bake it into the framework. We aim to design Molecule in an extensible way and in case you feel the feature is justified and we have to leave it out of the framework, you are free to build the necessary feature on top of the base framework capabilities. Molecule is not a kitchen sink. We justify each feature with atleaset three usecases. When in doubt we leave it out. We build general functionality which enables you to extend Molecule rather than adding every feature to the core framework.

You can refer to the [Molecule Roadmap](/roadmap) on details of when a particular feature is planned.
